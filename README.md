# PPE-Inventory-Management-System

This is an inventory management system for Personal Protection Equipment made to demonstrate my comprehension of structered programming concepts using Python.
Do note that since this project is solely dedicated to showcasing structered programming, therefore there is no GUI for this system.
This repository contains a zip file of the project alongside the supporting documentation. Installation guide is included in the appendix of the documentation
